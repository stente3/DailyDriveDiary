## About The Project

![alt text](https://github.com/stente3/DailyDriveDiary/blob/main/Design/main.png)

Welcome to our to-do list application designed to enhance your task management experience. Here's an overview of the key features that set our project apart:

### Multi-View Functionality:

Our to-do list empowers users with the ability to organize and categorize tasks through multiple views. You have the flexibility to choose between three distinct perspectives:

1. **All To-Do's:** A comprehensive view of all tasks, both completed and pending.
2. **Completed To-Do's:** Focus on your achievements by viewing only the completed tasks.
3. **Incomplete To-Do's:** Streamline your workflow by concentrating solely on pending tasks.

### Simulated Login for Seamless Experience:

To ensure a seamless experience without the need for a back-end, our application features a simulated login system.

### React Router for Intuitive Navigation:

We've integrated React Router to facilitate smooth navigation across various tabs within the application. The use of React Router ensures a user-friendly experience, allowing you to effortlessly switch between different views and functionalities.

### Secure To-Do Access:

Prioritizing user security, our application restricts access to the to-do list until the user logs in. This added layer of protection ensures that your tasks and information remain confidential, providing you with peace of mind.

### User Credentials:

To access the full features of the to-do list, use the following credentials:

- **Username:** root
- **Password:** root
